## About me
I am **AFellowSpeedrunner/MrMasterKeyboard**, creator of the LUM/MARINER project and the Buildroot3DS project which is a fork of the linux-3ds teams Buildroot port. I'm an autistic programmer teenager from Scotland who is hoping to get into University to do CompSci after high school and also has some experience in (not much of any, but a bit of) Rust, Python, Lua, C, C++, Assembly, HTML, CSS and Scratch! (if those last 3 count as a programming language, that's for you to decide.) I also speak some German. If you wanna see projects that I think are good or that I work on then check my pinned projects below this! I have more projects but I hid them because I don't work on them anymore and they are quite bad. I may un-private them at some point but for now, I'm gonna save myself the embarrassment. If you want to see some other stuff I created in my free time then check [the "myprogrammingdump" repository](https://github.com/afellowspeedrunner/myprogrammingdump)!

## What projects am I making currently?
- (Updates are on [my Mastodon page](https://mastodon.social/@MrMasterKeyboard)) [LUM/MARINER](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/LUM-MARINER) is a Rust kernel OS project that aims to be a clone of XNU/Darwin without the Apple components and branding and fully open-source. It is still very early in development, and contributions are highly appreciated!

- (Updates are on [my Mastodon page](https://mastodon.social/@MrMasterKeyboard)) [Buildroot3DS](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/Buildroot3DS), the first ever PROPER Linux distro for the 3DS family systems based off of the projects and work done by the ["linux-3ds"](https://github.com/linux-3ds) GitHub group. I am also modifing their Linux kernel 3DS port under [linux3ds-kernel](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/linux3ds-kernel).

- (Currently not public) LunaEFI and LunaOS, an EEPROM loader and OS for OcelotDesktop based off of the MineEFI and MineOS codebase which I am developing with my friend [@QM8782](https://github.com/QM8782).

- [A fan-translation of the](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page-english) ["kotoho7/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page" project.](https://github.com/kotoho7/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page) which I am doing with my friend [@QM8782](https://github.com/QM8782).

## What projects may I make in the future?
- Maybe a proxy unblocker?
