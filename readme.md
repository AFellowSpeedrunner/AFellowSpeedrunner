# Welcome to my profile!
## About me
I am **AFellowSpeedrunner/MrMasterKeyboard**, a programmer teenager from Scotland who has some experience in Python, C, C++, Assembly and Scratch! (if that counts as a programming language, that's up to you to decide xD) I also speak some German! If you wanna see projects that I think are good or that I work on then check my pinned projects below this! I have more projects but I hid them because I don't really work on them anymore. I may un-private them at some point but for now, I'm gonna save myself the embarrassment.

## What projects may I make in the future?
Maybe a proxy unblocker? That's number one on my list right now along with personal projects.
