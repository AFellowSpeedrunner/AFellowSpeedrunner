## About me
I am **AFellowSpeedrunner/MrMasterKeyboard**, creator of the SmolXP project (I no longer work on this project, also please stop liking that project. It doesn't showcase what I can do at all and anyone can easily do it within 5 minutes anyways.), and my Buildroot3DS project. (not the other one from the Linux-3DS project which this is based on.) I'm an autistic programmer teenager from Scotland who has some experience in (not much of any, but a bit of) Python, Lua, C, C++, Assembly, HTML, CSS and Scratch! (if those last 3 count as a programming language, that's for you to decide.) I also speak some German. If you wanna see projects that I think are good or that I work on then check my pinned projects below this! I have more projects but I hid them because I don't work on them anymore and they are quite bad. I may un-private them at some point but for now, I'm gonna save myself the embarrassment. If you want to see some other stuff I created in my free time then check [the "myprogrammingdump" repository](https://github.com/afellowspeedrunner/myprogrammingdump)!

## What projects am I making currently?
- [A fan-translation of the](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page-english) ["kotoho7/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page" project.](https://github.com/kotoho7/scratch-realtime-earthquake-viewer-page) which I am doing with my friend [@QM8782](https://github.com/QM8782).
- (Currently not public) LunaEFI and LunaOS, an EEPROM loader and OS for OcelotDesktop based off of the MineEFI and MineOS codebase which I am developing with my friend [@QM8782](https://github.com/QM8782).
- (Updates are on [my Mastodon page](https://mastodon.social/@MrMasterKeyboard)) [Buildroot3DS](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/Buildroot3DS), the first ever PROPER Linux distro for the 3DS family systems based off of the projects and work done by the ["linux-3ds"](https://github.com/linux-3ds) GitHub group. I am also modifing their Linux kernel 3DS port under [linux3ds-kernel](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/linux3ds-kernel).

## What projects may I make in the future?
- Maybe a proxy unblocker?
