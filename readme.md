## About me
I am **AFellowSpeedrunner/MrMasterKeyboard**, an autistic programmer teenager from Scotland who has some experience in Python, C, C++, Assembly and Scratch! (if that counts as a programming language, that's up to you to decide.) I also speak some German! If you wanna see projects that I think are good or that I work on then check my pinned projects below this! I have more projects but I hid them because I don't really work on them anymore. I may un-private them at some point but for now, I'm gonna save myself the embarrassment. If you want to see some other stuff I created in my free time then check the "myprogrammingdump" repository!

## What projects may I make in the future?
My upcoming 2009 to 2013 themed blog website over [here](https://afellowspeedrunner.github.io).  
Maybe a proxy unblocker?
