## About me
I am **AFellowSpeedrunner/MrMasterKeyboard**, creator of the SmolXP project. I'm an autistic programmer teenager from Scotland who has some experience in Python, C, C++, Assembly, HTML, CSS and Scratch! (if those last 3 count as a programming language, that's for you to decide.) I also speak some German. If you wanna see projects that I think are good or that I work on then check my pinned projects below this! I have more projects but I hid them because I don't work on them anymore and they are quite bad. I may un-private them at some point but for now, I'm gonna save myself the embarrassment. If you want to see some other stuff I created in my free time then check [the "myprogrammingdump" repository](https://github.com/afellowspeedrunner/myprogrammingdump)!

## What projects am I making currently?
- (Currently not public) LunaEFI and LunaOS, an EEPROM loader and OS for OcelotDesktop based off of the MineEFI and MineOS codebase which I am developing with my friend [@QM8782](https://github.com/QM8782).
- (Updates are on [my Mastodon page](https://mastodon.social/@MrMasterKeyboard)) [Buildroot3DS](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/Buildroot3DS), the first ever PROPER Linux distro for the 3DS family systems based off of the projects and work done by the "linux-3ds" GitHub group.
- [SmolXP](https://github.com/afellowspeedrunner/smolxp)! A big project of mine that has now gotten to 2.0!
- (ON HOLD) My upcoming 2009 to 2013 themed blog website over [here](https://afellowspeedrunner.github.io).  

## What projects may I make in the future?
- Maybe a proxy unblocker?
